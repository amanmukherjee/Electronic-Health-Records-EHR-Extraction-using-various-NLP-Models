# Electronic-Health-Records-EHR-Extraction-using-various-NLP-Models
With the rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), it is desirable to harvest information and knowledge from EHRs to support automated systems 
at the point of care and to enable secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. Therefore, we hope to gain some insights and develop strategies 
to improve the utilization of NLP in the clinical domain. We hope to provide insight into addressing the data challenge in this domain.
