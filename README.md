With the rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), it is desirable to harvest information and knowledge from EHRs to support automated systems at the point of care and to enable secondary use of EHRs for clinical and translational research. 
One critical component used to facilitate the secondary use of EHR data is the information extraction (IE) task, which automatically extracts and encodes clinical information from text.
NLP focuses on “developing computational models for understanding natural language”. An NLP system can include syntactic processing modules (e.g., tokenization, sentence detection, Part-of-Speech tagging) and/or semantic processing modules (e.g., named entity recognition, concept identification, relation extraction, anaphoric resolution). 
In the clinical domain, researchers have used NLP systems to identify clinical syndromes and common biomedical concepts from radiology reports, imaging data, discharge summaries, problem lists, nursing documentation, and medical education documents.
Therefore, we hope to gain some insights and develop strategies to improve the utilization of NLP in the clinical domain. We hope to provide insight into addressing the data challenge in this domain.
